## Portfolio Projects :bricks:
List of data analytics projects and technology stacks used to solve cases.

### Date and Drinks
**Tableau Public:** [`dashboard`](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/elizabeth.jeldres/viz/DateDrink/Dashboard1)

**Technology:** Tableau.

**Source:** [data.world](https://data.world/makeovermonday/2023w34)

**Skills:** data Visualization, designing an analytical dashboard, product delivery.    
  
**Description:** Tableau Public dashboard. Let's raise a virtual glass to data-driven dating insights! Fun and informative graphic delves into the fascinating world of date night drinks.
So, whether you're a beer aficionado or a wine connoisseur, classic cocktails like Martinis and Margaritas make their stylish appearances, offering a glimpse into the diversity of our dating preferences.
Join the conversation and share your own date night drink favorite, for me is Red wine: Carmenere! üöÄüíºü•Ç.

**Results:** According to the analytical and user-friendly dashboard insights, men are more likely to opt for casual drinks on dates, whereas women prefer classic wines. The dashboard, which was created with Tableau, effectively supports this idea and provides an   
engaging way to explore the fascinating world of date night drinks. You are sincerely invited to delve into the dashboard and share your preferred date night drink.

### Titanic Passengers
**Tableau Public:** [`dashboard`](https://public.tableau.com/views/TitanicPassengers_16914017462870/Titanicpassengers?:language=en-GB&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
**Technology:** Tableau.

**Source:** [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fossouodonald/titaniccsv)

**Skills:** Data visualization, designing an analytical dashboard.

**Description:** Tableau Public dashboard. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered ‚Äúunsinkable‚Äù RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren‚Äôt enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.
While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

**Results:** The survival of a young, unmarried, third-class man in the sinking of the Titanic is portrayed in the 1997 movie "Titanic". The film blends both factual and fictional elements to explore the plausibility of such an occurrence. Ultimately, it seems highly improbable that Jack could have made it out alive.
